### Summary

This was the first project I ever used an API with I went through the process of getting an API key with https://openweathermap.org/api and `fetch`ing the weather data from the API for a city or zip code that the user provides. This was also my first time converting a response from an API into JSON format. By using string interpolation, I was able to display the data in a way that's easy to read with the appropriate units.

I am especially proud of using the Moment.js library to convert the time of sunrise/sunset from UNIX to AM/PM as I had never used a library prior to this project.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create an app where the user can look up the current weather
- [x] Let the user search by city or zip code
- [x] Add new elements to the DOM upon searching to display the weather data

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Moment.js
